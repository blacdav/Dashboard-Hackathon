A hackathon sponsored by Geepay.africa. The frontend Challenge was to create a responsive dashboard from a Figma design provided, and to make it responsive. I took the challenge and participated in the hackathon, which ran for 4 days. The technologies I used are React, Chartjs for the chart provided, and Tailwind for styling. I did'nt finish the design at the end  of the hackathon, so i decided to move forward with the design to Finish.
